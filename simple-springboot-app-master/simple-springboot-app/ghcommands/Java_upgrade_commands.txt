PROMPT: Please assist me to rewrite or translate my Student.java class to be compatible with Java 17. Provide a detailed summary of updates along with the code to bring this class up to Java 17 compatibility. Highlight potential performance gains or readability improvements achieved through the upgrade.
 
Specifically:
 
•   Please do not eliminate or remove any methods from my existing Student.java code
•   Analyze the provided Student.java code and identify all necessary changes to ensure full compatibility with Java 17.
•   Adhere to Java 17 syntax and coding conventions.
•   All the methods in the class should be ported over in the new Java 17 compatible class.
•   Do not eliminate any properties.
•   Maintain the Serializable interface for backwards compatibility if possible.
•   Switch Expressions: Transform existing switch statements into cleaner Java 17+ switch expressions whenever possible. This can significantly improve readability.
•   Text Blocks: If Student.java contains string literals with multiple lines or complex formatting, demonstrate how Java 17 text blocks can streamline code.
•   Records: If your Student class or associated data types have many fields used primarily as data-holders, show how records can simplify them.
•   Pattern Matching: If Student.java uses instanceof checks followed by casting, refactor these with Java 17's pattern matching for instanceof for a cleaner syntax.
•   Replace the URL object with the most appropriate modern alternative from Java 17.
•   Update any other aspects of the code to adhere to Java 17 syntax and best practices.
